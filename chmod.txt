Basic Permission Types:

Read (r): Allows viewing file contents or listing directory contents
Write (w): Allows modifying file contents or adding/removing files in a directory
Execute (x): Allows running a file as a program or accessing a directory

Permission Categories:

Owner: The user who owns the file
Group: Users belonging to the file's group
Others: All other users

Advanced Topics:

1) Access Control Lists (ACLs): provides more fine-grained control over file permissions beyond the standard user/group/others model
`getfacl` filename - View ACLs
`setfacl` -m u:username:rwx filename - Set ACLs

2) Sticky bit: Used primarily on directories to prevent users from deleting files they don't own
`chmod +t directoryName`
Octal rep: 1000

3) Changing ownership: `chown` is used to change the file ownership.
Eg: chown newOwner filename, chown newOwner:newGroup filename
