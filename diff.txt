Difference between service and systemctl
- service operates on the files in /etc/init.d (old init system)
- systemctl operates on the files in /lib/systemd
- service is adequate for basic service management, while directly calling systemctl give greater control options
- service manages the services by interacting with the init script while systemctl manages the services by interacting with SystemD

Init software
- systemd
- SysV
- Upstart and more

ubuntu < 14.~ used Upstart, now most popular linux distros uses systemd

SysVInit is the classic initialization process in Linux.
The initialization process relies on the individual service to install relevant scripts on the /etc/init.d directory.
Additionally, the scripts must support the standard commands such as start, stop, and status.
One of the main characteristics of this init system is that it is a start-once process and does not track the individual services afterward.
The service command is used for running these init scripts from the terminal.

SystemD, on the other hand, is a recent initialization system that aims to replace SysVInit.
In fact, most Linux distributions such as Debian and Red Hat are already using SystemD as their init system out of the box.
In contrast to SysVInit, SystemD continues to run as a daemon process after the initialization is completed.
Additionally, they are also actively tracking the services through their cgroups.
The systemctl command is the entry point for users to interact and configures the SystemD.

cgroups (control groups) is a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of a collection of processes.
